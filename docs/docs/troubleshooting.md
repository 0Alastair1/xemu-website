## Windows Performance Considerations

### Integrated vs Discrete GPU

In some systems you may have both integrated and discrete GPUs. By default, xemu
will request the high-performance discrete GPU. However, system configuration
and your graphics driver ultimately decide which GPU xemu is initialized with.

In Windows, you can specify which GPU should be used for a particular
application by navigating to <kbd>Display settings</kbd>&rarr;<kbd>Graphics settings</kbd>.

You can confirm which GPU xemu is actually using by looking at the "xemu.log"
file.

### nVidia Settings

It is recommended to **disable** "Multi-threaded Optimizations" in the nVidia
Control Panel. This feature has been known to negatively impact xemu
performance.
