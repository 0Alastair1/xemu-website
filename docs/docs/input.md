Built on SDL2, xemu supports virtually all gamepads. Connect up to 4 controllers
at any time, just like a real Xbox.

!!! note
    * There is currently no interface within xemu to adjust the keybindings.
    * There is currently no interface to add/remove memory cards.

You can bind and unbind controllers in your system, just like a real Xbox.
