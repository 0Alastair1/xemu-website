xemu is a free and open-source application that emulates the original Microsoft
Xbox game console, enabling people to play their original Xbox games on Windows,
macOS, and Linux systems.

xemu is maintained and developed by Matt Borgerson. xemu is a continuation of
the XQEMU project, originally started by espes in 2011 with significant
contributions from Matt Borgerson (mborgerson), Jannik Vogel (JayFoxRox), and
others. xemu is based on the excellent QEMU full system emulator project.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"

    This project is for educational purposes only, with the goal of researching
    and understanding the inner-workings of the original Xbox and its games, and
    then building a platform to play those legally purchased games.

    This project does not endorse or promote copyright infringement of any kind.
    Developers work with legal backups of their own physical media and encourage
    all users to do the same. Piracy is not tolerated on any communication
    channel.

## System Requirements

xemu runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. An OpenGL 4.0-compatible GPU is
required. Most recent integrated GPUs will work.

Please note that xemu is an evolving project and, although xemu can run on large
number of systems, actual game performance is in flux and will vary based on the
characteristics of your system.

## Open Source Development

xemu is developed on GitHub at https://github.com/mborgerson/xemu. Contributions
